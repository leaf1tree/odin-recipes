            <p>
                A traditional thai curry made with cocounut milk, green chilies, kaffir lime leaves, and thai basil. Fiery, 
                aromatic, and creamy, it is the perfect dish for chilly weather. All essential ingredients store well in the
                pantry, and the minimal active cook time makes it perfect for busy families.
            </p> 
            <p> The curry is best paired with steamed rice. </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
            <ul>
                <li> Coconut milk</li>
                <li>Green curry paste (I recommend May Ploy or Aroy D brands)</li>
                <li>Protein of choice (chicken, tofu, pork)</li>
                <li>Vegetables of your choice (eggplant, red bell peppers, bamboo shoots, carrots)</li>
                <li>Fish sauce</li>
                <li>Kaffir lime leaves</li>
                <li>Thai basil to garnish</li>
                <li>Neutral oil</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a tablespoon of neutral oil in a pot. Once shimmering, fry the curry paste (curry paste
                    is what gives the curry it's signature flavor. Add less to make a milder curry) until 
                    the oil has been slightly stained and curry paste becomes aromatic. Do not burn the curry paste.
                    This should take 1-2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add a can of coconut milk and break up any large clumps of curry paste. Turn to medium heat. </li>
                <li>Once at a simmer, add the protein. Cook until 50% done. </li>
                <li>Add vegetables of your choice and kaffir lime leaves. Simmer until vegetables are cooked.</li>
                <li>Add fish sauce, sugar, and thai basil to taste. </li>
            </ol>
